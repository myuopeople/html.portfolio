<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="../assets/images/solo1.JPG" height="200">
<p>Meet Solomon Chijioke  whose passion for technology began from childhood, 
  Solomon taught himself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through online tutorials 
  and late-night coding sessions. His curiosity and drive led him to build 
  small websites for friends, local businesses, and school projects.</p>
  
  <p>What sets Solomon apart is his creativity and attention to detail. 
  Whether he's designing a sleek portfolio site or developing a dynamic 
  e-commerce platform, he focuses on clean design and user-friendly functionality. 
  He’s also expanding his skills in backend development, working with tools 
  like Node.js and Firebase.</p>

<p>Solomon dreams of launching his own tech startup someday, but for now, he’s 
building his portfolio, learning new frameworks like React, and collaborating 
with others to solve real-world problems through code. His journey is just 
beginning, but his ambition and talent already shine bright in the digital world.</p>

<p>Thank you....</p>
